# Documentation Generator

**Documentation Generator** is a lightweight WPF desktop application that automatically generates structured documentation from **XML comments** in C# source files. Designed to save developers time, it transforms existing code comments into clean, professional PDF documents with minimal effort.

## Why I Built This
Writing technical documentation can be repetitive‚Äîespecially when the code is already self-documented.  
This tool bridges the gap by turning XML comments into formal documentation, streamlining workflows and reducing busywork.

## Features
- **Flexible Input** ‚Äì Select individual files or scan entire directories  
- **Automated Parsing** ‚Äì Reads XML comments directly from C# source code  
- **Documentation Output** ‚Äì Generates organized, ready-to-use PDF documents  


## Future Plans
I am planning to add support for multiple programming languages including C++, Vb.NET and more.
